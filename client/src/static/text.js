    "The goal of CodeTogether is to make the Open Source world more accessible to junior computer science students.\
    We want to help others comprehend the open source world because it illustrates the working method of a team in the industry,\
    as there aren't many courses that genuinely supply suitable tools for the real world industry.\
    A contribution to open source can demonstrate professional aptitude, expand a person's portfolio, and hone their programming skills.",

    openSource:
    'Open source is a term used to describe software whose source code is made publicly available and can be viewed, modified, and distributed by anyone.\
    Open source software is typically created by a community of developers who collaborate to create and improve the software.\
    As a programmer, open source provides you with an opportunity to learn, contribute, and collaborate with other developers worldwide.\
    By working on open source projects, you can gain practical experience in coding, debugging, and testing software.\
    Additionally, you can interact with other developers and learn new coding techniques and best practices.\
    Open source is an excellent opportunity for computer science students to gain practical experience and learn from others.',

    howToStart:
    'To start the process of contributing to a specific project, go to the "Projects" page and select a project that interests you.\
    Since each project uses a particular coding environment and programming language, each project manager must write their own contribution file, which should be included in every project repository inside the Github link and explain in more detail how to contribute code.\
    Users can also contact the project creator by visiting the URL shown under "contact" in the project card.'
